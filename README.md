# Mariel KuncArt

This is a small website I built to showcase my mom’s artwork. It’s a personal project meant to give her art a simple online home where people can browse her pieces in a clean layout.

It’s not meant to be a big production app — just a straightforward gallery-style site and a good excuse for me to practice building with Next.js.

## What This Site Does

- Displays artwork and images
- Shows a simple gallery-style layout
- Lets visitors browse pieces easily
- Uses reusable UI components

## Why I Built It

I built this project to:

- Create a simple site for my mom’s art
- Get hands-on practice with Next.js
- Work with routing, components, and layouts
- Practice structuring a small real-world site

It’s intentionally lightweight and focused on clarity over complexity.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript (use whichever applies)
- Tailwind

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
